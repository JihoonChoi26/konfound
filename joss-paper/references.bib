	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is en route to becoming an integral part of mathematical modeling. The tremendous potential benefits of SA are, however, yet to be fully realized, both for advancing mechanistic and data-driven modeling of human and natural systems, and in support of decision making. In this perspective paper, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners revisit the current status of SA, and outline research challenges in regard to both theoretical frameworks and their applications to solve real-world problems. Six areas are discussed that warrant further attention, including (1) structuring and standardizing SA as a discipline, (2) realizing the untapped potential of SA for systems modeling, (3) addressing the computational burden of SA, (4) progressing SA in the context of machine learning, (5) clarifying the relationship and role of SA to uncertainty quantification, and (6) evolving the use of SA in support of decision making. An outlook for the future of SA is provided that underlines how SA must underpin a wide variety of activities to better serve science and society.},

	abstract = {Regression coefficients cannot be interpreted as causal if the relationship can be attributed to an alternate mechanism. One may control for the alternate cause through an experiment (e.g., with random assignment to treatment and control) or by measuring a corresponding confounding variable and including it in the model. Unfortunately, there are some circumstances under which it is not possible to measure or control for the potentially confounding variable. Under these circumstances, it is helpful to assess the robustness of a statistical inference to the inclusion of a potentially confounding variable. In this article, an index is derived for quantifying the impact of a confounding variable on the inference of a regression coefficient. The index is developed for the bivariate case and then generalized to the multivariate case, and the distribution of the index is discussed. The index also is compared with existing indexes and procedures. An example is presented for the relationship between socioeconomic background and educational attainment, and a reference distribution for the index is obtained. The potential for the index to inform causal inferences is discussed, as are extensions.},

	abstract = {We contribute to debate about causal inferences in educational research in two ways. First, we quantify how much bias there must be in an estimate to invalidate an inference. Second, we utilize Rubin?s causal model to interpret the bias necessary to invalidate an inference in terms of sample replacement. We apply our analysis to an inference of a positive effect of Open Court Curriculum on reading achievement from a randomized experiment, and an inference of a negative effect of kindergarten retention on reading achievement from an observational study. We consider details of our framework, and then discuss how our approach informs judgment of inference relative to study design. We conclude with implications for scientific discourse.},
